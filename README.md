# Predicting-whether-or-not-a-user-will-click-on-a-Ad-using-Logistic-Regression
In this project, I worked with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. I create a logistic regression model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
The data used for this project can be found in advertising.csv; the python code is in the notebook. All code is written in Python 3.
Model used is Logistic Regression.
